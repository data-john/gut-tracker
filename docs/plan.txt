Development Plan
1. Set Up the Development Environment
A robust development environment ensures smooth coding, testing, and deployment.
Install Python:
Ensure Python 3.x (e.g., 3.9 or later) is installed on your development machine. Verify with python3 --version.

Create a Virtual Environment:
Isolate project dependencies using python3 -m venv venv. Activate it with source venv/bin/activate (Linux/Mac) or venv\Scripts\activate (Windows).

Install Kivy:
Since Kivy is a popular Python framework for Android apps, install it with pip install kivy. 

Install Additional Libraries:
Install required libraries:
sqlite3 (built-in with Python) for local storage.

matplotlib (pip install matplotlib) for potential analytics visualizations, if Kivy’s native graphics are insufficient.

Set Up Buildozer:
Install Buildozer (pip install buildozer) to package the app into an APK. Install Android SDK and NDK as per Buildozer’s documentation, ensuring compatibility with your OS.

3. Design the App’s Architecture
A clear architecture ensures the app is modular and maintainable.
Define App Screens:
Plan the following screens:
Home Screen: Entry point with options to log a bowel movement, view the calendar, or see analytics.

Logging Screen: Form with the mini survey.

Calendar View: Displays logged entries by date.

Analytics Screen: Shows basic statistics and trends.

Design the Data Model:
Define fields for bowel movement records:
date_time: Timestamp (e.g., “2023-10-15 14:30”).

consistency: Integer (1-7, based on the Bristol Stool Scale).

color: String (e.g., “brown”, “green”, "yellow", "black").

blood_presence: String ("None", "Little", "Lots").

pain: String ("None", "Itching", "Mild Pain while passing", "Mild Pain while passing and afterwards", "Constant throbbing pain", "Sharp pain while passing", "Sharp pain while passing and afterwards")

symptoms: String (e.g., “bloating, cramping”).

Plan the Database:
Use SQLite for local storage. Create a table bowel_movements with columns matching the data model, using appropriate data types (e.g., INTEGER, TEXT, DATETIME).

4. Implement the Logging Feature
The logging feature is the app’s core input mechanism.
Create the Logging Screen:
Use Kivy’s ScreenManager to add a LogScreen. Define it in a .kv file or Python code.

Design the Mini Survey:
Build a form with multiple-choice options using Kivy widgets:
Consistency: Radio buttons or a dropdown for Bristol Stool Scale (1-7).

Color: Dropdown with options (e.g., brown, green, yellow).

Blood Presence: Dropdown with options.

Pain: Dropdown with options.

Symptoms: Multiple checkboxes (e.g., bloating, cramping, none).

Validate Input:
Ensure required fields (e.g., date, consistency) are completed before saving. Display an error message if validation fails.

Save the Record:
On form submission, insert the data into the SQLite database using a function like insert_bowel_movement(data).

5. Develop the Calendar View
The calendar provides a visual history of logged entries.
Build a simple calendar using Kivy’s GridLayout.

Display Entries:
Mark dates with logged entries using colors or icons:
Green for normal consistency (e.g., 3-4 on Bristol scale).

Red if blood is present or pain is high (>7).

Enable Date Selection:
Add an on-tap event to each date cell, displaying a popup or screen with details of that day’s logs (e.g., time, consistency, symptoms).

6. Add Simple Analytics
Analytics offer insights into gut health trends.
Calculate Metrics:
Write functions to compute:
Frequency: Number of bowel movements per week.

Average Consistency: Mean Bristol score over a period.

Pain Trends: Average pain level over time.

Visualize Data:
Use Kivy’s canvas for simple bar charts or integrate matplotlib for line graphs showing consistency or frequency trends.

Display Analytics:
Create an AnalyticsScreen with labels for metrics and a graph section, updating dynamically based on database queries.

7. Implement Data Storage
Persistent storage ensures data is retained between app sessions.
Set Up SQLite Database:
Initialize the database on app startup with a CREATE TABLE statement for bowel_movements.

Implement CRUD Operations:
Write functions:
insert_bowel_movement(data): Add a new record.

get_logs_by_date(date): Retrieve logs for a specific day.

get_all_logs(): Fetch all records for analytics.

Optimize Queries:
Use indexes on date_time for faster retrieval in the calendar and analytics views.

8. Ensure Data Privacy and Security
Protecting user health data is critical.
Encrypt the Database (Optional):
Use sqlcipher (pip install pysqlcipher3) to encrypt the SQLite database, requiring a key stored securely within the app.

Limit Data Access:
Ensure data stays local and isn’t shared externally. Avoid unnecessary permissions in the APK.

Inform Users:
Add a settings or info screen explaining that data is stored locally and securely, enhancing transparency.

9. Test the App
Thorough testing ensures reliability and usability.
Write Unit Tests:
Use pytest to test database functions (e.g., insert_bowel_movement) and analytics calculations.

Perform UI Testing:
Manually test each screen:
Logging: Verify survey options save correctly.

Calendar: Check date markers and selection.

Analytics: Confirm metrics match logged data.

Test on Android Devices:
Use an emulator (e.g., Android Studio’s AVD) and a physical device to ensure compatibility across screen sizes and Android versions.

10. Package and Deploy
Prepare the app for Android deployment.
Configure Buildozer:
Edit buildozer.spec to set:
App name: “Gut Health Tracker”

Package name: com.yourname.guthealth

Version: “1.0”

Permissions: Minimal (e.g., storage if needed).

Build the APK:
Run buildozer android debug to generate the APK. Troubleshoot errors using Buildozer logs.

Test the APK:
Install the APK on a device with adb install <apk-file>. Verify all features work as expected.

Consider Distribution:
Optionally, create a Google Play Developer account ($25 one-time fee) and publish the app after further polish.
